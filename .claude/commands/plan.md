You will invoke the `feature-planning-agent` sub-agent to review any documentation found in the `.claude/references/$ARGUMENTS/` directory. It should be instructed that its task name is `$ARGUMENTS`. When that agent has completed its plan, invoke the `plan-reviewing-agent`, telling it to thoroughly review the plan found at `.claude/tasks/$ARGUMENTS.md` and provide feedback.

You will provide any feedback to the `feature-planning-agent`, asking it to revise the work based on the feedback. Upon completion, invoke the `plan-reviewing-agent` to review and provide feedback or approve the changes. Continue this cycle until the `plan-reviewing-agent` has approved the plan, then return a summary of the work done to the end user.
